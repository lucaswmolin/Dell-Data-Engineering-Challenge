Conclusions

As a result of data analysis, I found that by the 50th week of 2021 there were more than 273 million cases of COVID-19 around the world, with the United States, India, Brazil, United Kingdom and Russia among the top 5. 
However, considering cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the top 5 was made up of the countries Bahrain, Seychelles, Andorra, United Arab Emirates and Gibraltar.

In the same context, the total number of deaths was over 5 million. 
The 10 countries with the highest number of deaths were, respectively, USA, Brazil, India, Russia, Mexico, Peru, United Kingdom, Indonesia, Italy and Iran. 
However, in deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, Peru led the ranking, followed by Bulgaria, Macedonia, Hungary and Gibraltar.

To calculate the Pearson correlation between number of cases and number of cell phones, a coefficient of 0.55 was obtained, indicating a weak correlation.

To calculate the Pearson correlation between number of cases and number of visitors, a coefficient of 0.60 was obtained, indicating a moderated correlation.
